## Requirements

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Build the Docker image (add your openAI and telegram keys, and also graphql endpoint): `docker build --build-arg GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT='your-graphql-endpoint' --build-arg OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key' --build-arg TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='your_telegram_bot_token' -t telegram-bot .`
2. Run the Docker container: `docker run telegram-bot`

- `/query insert your question here` is the main thing
- `/query_info` provides documentation on the endpoint schema (if you don't know the schemas you might ask for impossible queries and it will throw error saying it can't do it)
